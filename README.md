framework for building a random book of the day generator from copyright-free Project Gutenberg uploads

uploads daily, picks a book*, and stores it in the the irreguolar library

clone in and run with 'python PG_daily_uploads.py'

*Currently all language's are accepted, not just english. That's by design. Wouldn't it be boring if everything was written in the same language.

ToDo:

    -set as a recurring task at > 2:00 am EST
    -some custom formatting on the txt files/check out some e-reader formatting systems
